## Skateboard

For this assignment, I had to use Onshape to create a CAD skateboard. This project included multiple parts that had to then be assembled. After assembly, I went back and improved some of the parts to make them more realistic.

This part of the assignment was pretty straighforward. The most important part was to do a revolved extrusion instead of a normal one. This makes it much easier due to the circular shape of the object, and it makes it much easier to come back later and change the dimensions if necessary. The bearing could just be sketched within the wheel after it was extruded and the middle of the bearing could be set in by sketching a new circle and cutting away part of the bearing.

After creating all the necessary parts, I assembled them into the final product. This was fairly easy to do. All of the mate connectors that I needed were already there, so I just had to snap the pieces together. I also had to go in the Onshape standard parts libray and add in screws and nuts for the trucks and wheels. For this part, it is neccessary to make sure you use the exact right parts, otherwise they will not fit correctly.
